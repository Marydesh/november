* This application generates an the SVG file with a logo image. It prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

* I created Triangle, Circle, and Square classes(shapes.js file ), as well as tests for each of these classes.


* Assistance with the code I got from my tutors:
